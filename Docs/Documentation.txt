Step 1: Define the Data Model for Intent
    I basically need a well-defined, validated structure for what the LLM will return.
    This ensures that the rest of our application can reliably work with the LLM's output.
    I'll use Pydantic for this, which enforces data types and validation. 

    Used classes as I'm making sure that I follow SOLID principles.

Step 2: Define the Abstract LLM interface
    I'll define the contract for any LLM parser we might use. This abstraction allows us to
    easily swap out OpenRouter for another service (maybe OpenAI or local LLM(If I care enought to develop one!))
    in the future without changing the rest of the application.
    (Again I looked forward to adhere to the SOLID).
